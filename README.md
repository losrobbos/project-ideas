## Entry level (1-3 days)

### Rock paper scissors with a browser UI
    - In UI you pick a name and select a move
    - The opponents move will be a random move
    - Write the function to check who won
    - Display the winner and offer a new game
    - Bonus: Store the game result in the browser
    => research how to use local storage

### Terminal games (backend only)
   
Research (foundation for all games): 
    - terminology "Socket" and "TCP"
    - the net package of node.js
    - how to open a port / create a socket
    - how to listen to incoming calls
    - how to listen to keyboard events
    - how to write messages to a socket

#### Rock paper scissors

- Setup a TCP game server
- On an incoming request: 
    - Let the user choose a user name that will be shown a prefix to his messages, like to: [rob]: Hello
    - you pick a move via stdin, player picks random move

#### Terminal chat

- Simulate a chat between two parties via a socket
- Create a script tcp-server.js
- Create a script tcp-client.js
- On an incoming request: Write a chat welcome message
- On typing and sending a new chat message: Write the message to the socket so the other party receives it
    - Both server and client can send and receive messages from the other party
- When client closes connection (via CTRL+C)
    - Server should listen for the connection closing event
    - Server should write the chat log to a file chat_history.txt

## Medium (up to 2 weeks)

### Browser games

#### Flappy bird

=> showcase: https://flappybird.io/
- Create a browser game with animations
- Choose graphics from pixabay, unsplash or other free image resources
- On mouse click or hitting the spacebar key: Move up the bird
- If the bird touches a tube: 
    - Catch this event & Quit the game
    - Grey out the display area and display “GameOver”
    - Offer a button “New Game”
- On every passed tube: Count up the score
- The more tubes you pass the more you gain
- On game finish:
    - Store your scores for a player in the frontend:
        - Let the user type in a player name (or offer generation of a random player name)
        - Basic Version: Use LocalStorage to store data
        - Advanced Version: Use IndexedDB to store data


#### Minesweeper
            
=> showcase: http://minesweeperonline.com/
- Build a UI – build an HTML matrix with 10 x 10 squares (might be an array :))
    - Randomly place 10 bombs inside this matrix (the bombs are hidden)
    - suggestion: use HTML data-attributes to store bomb status in the button
        => research: HTML data-attribute
- Once you start a game: Count the seconds and display them (=game time)
- React to click events on a square
    - On a click: Evaluate if you clicked on a bomb
    - On a right click: Mark a field as a bomb
- If bomb clicked: Game is lost
- If no bomb clicked: Evaluate the “environment”. Do the surroundings have bombs? And how many? Write an algorithm that checks it.
- Bonus:
    - You can play 3 levels: Beginner, Medium, Expert
    - Beginner: generate a matrix of 10 x 10 fields with 10 bombs
    - Medium: generate a matrix of 15 x 15 fields with 40 bombs
    - Expert: generate a matrix of 15 x 30 fields with 100 bombs

#### News Feed

- Create a news application for your favorite interest area
- Project kickoff instructions
    - Create a backend with an HTTP server
        - Create a route which delivers a news item entry form as HTML
        - The form asks for a news category, title and the news message 
        - On entry: Save the news item internally (array + file storage)
        - Emit an event that there is new news, and send the new news item to the event queue
    - Create a UI to display the news
        - Use socket.io to react to new incoming news. Add them in real-time to the DOM (no reload of the page)

#### Chat Application

- Setup a backend server that 
    - listens for chat events (via socket io)
        - a valid chat message must contain: the message and the user who wrote the message
    - forwards / emits incoming chat messages to all users (via socket.io)
        - send the message together with the user who wrote it
- Setup a chat frontend
    - Display all current chat messages via HTML / CSS (e.g. in a textarea)
    - Listen to incoming chat messages via socket io
    - Add new incoming chat message to the chat display area
        - Prefix the message with the user who send the message

### Social Media

#### Discussion forum

- You have a main view with discussion topics 
- Each discussion topic can have multiple posts
- And each post can have answers. And these answers can have answers again

Key Concepts to learn:
- Tree structures (=Parents with children, that have children, that have children, etc)
- Practice Algorithm for “looping” through trees: Recursion
- Reading / writing JavaScript data from / to the filesystem

Project kickoff instructions:
- Write a backend that
    - provides an array of topics and all subtopics
    - On load: It reads the topics from a file an loads it into the array 
    - All changes to that arr are again saved to that file
    - Offer a route to fetch a post with all of its subposts
    - Offer a route to receive new incoming discussion entries /answers for a topic / post
        - add the new discussion entry into the topics array / topics file
- Write a frontend that
    - Displays all main topics
    - On click on a topic: show this topic with all sub-threads
    - Indent the sub-answers correctly
        - Use recursion to loop through all posts and subposts, building up the discussion tree
    - Besides each post: Provide a button to reply to it
    - On button click: Forward the user to a post answer page
    - Post answer page: Provide a form to answer the post and a button “Submit answer”

## Advanced (long term – 2 weeks up to several months)

### Real Time data

Applications that provide live data in real time (= data in UI is updated very frequently)

#### The Stock trader

- Write an app that displays current DAX Stock prices in real time 
    => the prices can be fake, no need to connect to a real stock price service here
- Key concepts to learn
    - RealTime data with WebSockets / bidirectional data streams
    - Library Socket.io
    - Bonus:
        - Authentication
            - OAuth and Social Login
        - PayPal Payment API
        - Stripe Payment API
- Project kickoff instructions
    - Write a backend which 
        - randomly increases / decreases prices for each stock every second
        - emit an event via socket.io on each price update
    - Write a UI which
        - Fetches and displays all stocks
        - Reacts to price changes and updates the stock items in real time (without any reloads of the page)
    - Bonus: 
        - Backend 
            - maintain customer portfolios of shares
            - add social login (via Facebook, Google or GitHub)

        - UI: 
            - Provide a Login for the user to see his portfolio
            - Portfolio: Allow buying and selling of shares to the current market price
            - Customers have a cash account that is used to order stocks
                - Initialize this cash account with 1000 EUR 
                - On buy / sell: Update the customers cash balance
            - If they do not have enough cash 
                - they need to fill it up with new money from PayPal or Creditcard otherwise they cannot buy stocks anymore
                - The users can state the amount they want to transfer
                - => use the either the PayPal Test API or the Stripe CreditCard Test API for that
                - On successful transaction: Add the amount to the customers cash balance
                - Now they can buy stocks again

        - For each product: Provide a buy button
        - On “buy Product” click: Call the route product/add
        - Store the returned session ID in a cookie => research how to do that with JavaScript
            - If there is already a session ID in the browser: do not add it
        - After the backend responded => forward the user to a shopping cart page
        - Provide a Shopping cart page

### Streaming

#### Video course

- Produce a small video course of 5-10 videos
    - Shoot some videos with your smartphone camera, photo camera laptop webcam
    - These videos do not really need to have serious course content. But it is a good side-learning to try out for practicing presenting skills, a skill you could really benefit from a lot in your career if you practice it
- Key Concepts to practice: 
    - The Video tag in HTML5
    - NodeJS streams
    - HTTP partly responses => range header
    - Authentication with JSON Web Tokens
    - BONUS: Presentation skills
- Project kickoff instructions
    - Create a UI
        - Login UI with email and password
        - Video course page listing all videos of the course
        - Video view page where you can watch a single video
            - This page should contain a HTML5 video player (use the HTML \<video\> tag)
        - Serve all this UIs via a NodeJS HTTP or Express HTTP server
        - => Recommendation: HTTP server to really learn the fundamentals of frontend-	backend interaction
        - => Express is much easier in the long-run. But you have to learn it first
    - Create a backend video server
        - Store your videos in a course folder
        - Provide a route which returns the video player UI page
        - Provide a route which accepts a video ID and streams back the video with this ID
    - Add authentication
        - Add JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to your project
            - => research this topic
        - On each request to your backend (except the login route): 
            - Check if the HTTP header “Authorization” is present
            - If not this means: the user is not logged in and we deny the request
            - Not logged in users are always redirected back to the route /login
            - If you are using express: 
                - use a middleware for that auth check
                - => Research how to inject a middleware function on each incoming request
                - If your are not using express: 
                    - Write a function for the auth check which is executed on every incoming request. Research how to do that
        - Provide a route on the backend to authenticate a user by email and password
            - Check the user credentials against an array of users
            - If user email and password is correct => create a JSON web token
            - => research how to do this in NodeJS (you need to install a package for that)
            - Return back the JSON web token
        - Frontend adaptation
            - The login frontend form 
                - After submit the form needs to wait for the auth on the backend to finish
                - Afterwards it will store the received token in localStorage
                - => research what browser LocalStorage is and how to store data in the browser

- Research the Electron framework
- https://electronjs.org/
- Write your first app to learn the fundamentals: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app

Motivation for desktop apps: 
- Very fast / high performance
- Access your computer resources, e.g. files, folders

### Software Deployment with Docker

- Docker is the de facto standard of deploying software together with its environment on a server
    - e.g. install your node js application together with node and mongoDB out-of-the-box
    - or install your wordpress blog together with PHP and MySQL out-of-the-box
    => this (almost) assures your software will run everywhere like it runs on your local PC
- Install Docker: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04
- Full introduction course (quite long): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo
    - You can also start off by reading the official docks instead of a course
- Run your first hello world container
- Demo - Setup wordpress
    - Install wordpress from the official docker image
    - Startup your wordpress blog in a local server + database
- Learn about Docker Images and the central         Docker Image Repository
